# Set up the Wall Follow Dashboard service on a stock Neoracer.
#
# On the car:
#   git clone https://github.com/Neobotics-Foundation-Inc/wallfollow_dashboard.git
#   bash wallfollow_dashboard/setup.sh
#
# The service runs the files where this repository already sits. setup.sh
# writes that path into the unit and copies nothing, so the checkout can live
# anywhere. Idempotent: safe to re-run.
#
# A first install leaves neoracer-wallfollow.service installed, stopped, and
# disabled; start it with `bash setup.sh enable`. A re-run keeps whatever state
# the service is in, restarting it only when it is already running.
#
# Subcommands:
#   (none)    install or update the unit; a first install does not start it
#   enable    start now and at every boot
#   disable   stop now and keep off across boots
#   restart   restart the service, taking port 8081 back first
#   remove    stop, disable, and uninstall the unit; files here are kept
#
# Needs nothing beyond the stock image: ROS Humble at /opt/ros/humble, the
# driver workspace at /home/racecar/ros2_ws, and the racecar user.
